# Palo Alto's Adventure

## Overview

  Palo Alto's Adventure, is a 2-d downhill snowboarding game where the main character - Alto - slides down a series of slopes   while avoiding obsticles. The game is in perpetual motion where the only control is the spacebar - which allows Alto to jump   if tapped and perform a backflip if held-down.
